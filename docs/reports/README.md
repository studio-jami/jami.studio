# Rebuild — Feasibility Reports (final-shape pre-planning)

**Stage:** the end-to-end, final-shape pre-planning layer. Each report owns one
responsibility/concern, **canons down** from the `research/` trail, and **cements the
remaining peripheral decisions** for its corner. This is the working surface we plan and
implement against.

**Two layers, clean separation:**
- **`../research/` = the thinking layer (preserved).** History, fact-finding, and the living
  **Operating Canon** (`research/00-orchestration/plan.md`) + **System map**
  (`research/00-orchestration/synthesis.md`). Stays as "how we got here & why."
- **`docs/reports/` = the final-shape spec (this).** Cohesive, decisive, implementation-oriented.
  Cites research sources; does not repeat them.

**Status:** AUTHORED 2026-06-02 — full single-author pass complete across F01–F24 (all 8 sections fleshed; dependencies cross-linked by F## id; drift-prone facts dated). Open founder calls flagged `> needs Jamie` in §4; no canon-change flags raised.

## The set (24 reports, 5 domains)

## Per-report template (every report follows this shape)

```
Header: Status · Domain · Owner · Canons-from (research/) · Related reports
1. Scope & responsibility (in / out)
2. Committed decisions (from canon)
3. Architecture & mechanics (end-to-end; the contracts & seams)
4. Remaining peripheral decisions to cement   ← the heart of this stage
5. Dependencies & interfaces (cross-report links)
6. Verification & closing criteria (definition of done)
7. Risks & verify-at-build (drift-prone facts, dated)
8. Sources

## Open decisions (`needs Jamie`) — consolidated from the set's §4s

The reports cement every derivable decision; these are the genuine creative / scope / expert calls left open (each lives in the cited report's §4). **Status: AUTHORED — set complete; these are the periphery to close on Jamie's clock.**

**Creative — one naming sweep** (canon §4): SaaS suite names · Intercal/Collective product names · etymara + free-tool names · the CLI name. → F01, F16, F18, F21.
**Creative — visual + narrative:** the visual identity itself (logomark/palette/type) → F18 · the pitch deck's narrative voice + theme → F20.
**Scope — pricing/packaging:** per-suite pricing numbers → F21 · Kit price + packaging + firm placement under yrka → F14 · billing default provider (MoR-leaning, couples to pricing) → F12.
**Expert-gated:** entity TYPE + tool + incorporation timing → **CPA** (QSBS clock) → F22 · license confirmation (Apache / MIT→Apache notices / DCO / MakerKit clean-room) → **IP counsel** → F14.
**Quick founder prefs:** banking provider (Mercury recommended) → F23 · funding-program prioritization → F20.
**Resolved to default (no action):** founder-facts DRY shape = one org-lane `founder.yaml` → F17.

## Authoring plan
One cohesive agent authors the full set against the canon + synthesis + research (single
author = consistent voice, cross-references, and decisions — not fragmented). Each report:
states committed decisions from canon, specs the mechanics end-to-end, **drives its §4
peripheral decisions to closure**, cross-links dependencies, dates any drift-prone fact, and
cites its `research/` sources. The canon stays authoritative; reports never contradict it
(if a report surfaces a needed change, it's raised, not silently diverged).
