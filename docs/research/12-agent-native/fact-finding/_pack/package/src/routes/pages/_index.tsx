 * Run the redirect on both the server and the client. A client-only
 * `<Navigate>` can drop during hydration (before the route tree is fully
 * attached), leaving the user stranded on `/` with a blank main area while
 * the layout chrome around it still renders. A `loader` redirect runs as
 * part of the server response and the navigation completes before the app
 * hydrates; `clientLoader` covers SPA-style navigations to `/`.
 *
 * We preserve `?` and `#` so deep-links like `?thread=<id>` from a Slack
 * "Open thread" button survive the bounce — `useThreadDeepLink` in
 * `root.tsx` reads them after the redirect lands and opens `/chat`.
