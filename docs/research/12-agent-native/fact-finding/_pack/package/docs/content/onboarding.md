# Onboarding

When you first open an app built on the agent-native framework, you'll see a
**Setup** checklist in the agent sidebar. It keeps first-run configuration close
to the agent chat: connect an AI engine, optionally point the app at shared
infrastructure, and add providers only when you need them.

## For end users

### What you'll see

- A **Setup** panel above the agent chat with a checklist like "Connect an AI
  engine", "Email delivery", etc.
- A counter at the top (e.g. "1 of 4") shows how many steps are ready.
- The current step is expanded; finished steps show a green check and stay
  readable if you open them.
- Required steps show a small red **required** pill. The panel stays visible
  until every required step is complete.
- Once everything required is done, the panel hides itself automatically.
- The whole panel can be collapsed with the chevron in the top-right, or
  hidden entirely with **Hide setup** at the bottom.

### How to complete each step

Steps offer one or more **methods** — different ways to satisfy the same
requirement. The primary path is shown first; secondary paths are kept compact
behind a picker or disclosure when a step has several equivalent providers.

- **Connect a service (one click)** — e.g. _Connect Builder_ for the managed
  AI gateway. Click the button, a window opens, you sign in, the window closes,
  and the step is marked complete. No keys to copy.
- **Paste an API key or fill a form** — e.g. choose an LLM provider, database,
  OAuth provider, or email provider, paste the value(s), click **Save**.
  Secret fields use a password input so the value isn't shown on screen. Saved
  values go into your local `.env` (or workspace settings) — see
  [Security](/docs/security) for where they live.
- **Open a link** — some steps point to a sign-in page or docs. Click
  **Continue** and finish the flow in the new tab.
- **Ask the agent** — a few steps offer a "Let the agent set it up" option.
  Click it and the agent picks up in the chat, walking you through any
  external setup (creating OAuth credentials, etc.).

### The built-in steps you'll usually see

- **Connect an AI engine** (required) — the only mandatory step. Connect
  Builder for a one-click managed gateway, or open the secondary provider-key
  picker and paste your own LLM key.
- **Database** (optional) — set `DATABASE_URL` when you want to use a specific
  SQL database connection string.
- **Authentication** (optional) — built-in email/password accounts work by
  default. Add OAuth or access-token sign-in only when you want those paths.
- **Email delivery** (optional) — useful before deploy for password resets,
  team invitations, and share notifications. Use the provider you already use;
  local development can run without it.

Templates can add their own steps on top of these — e.g. a CRM template might
add "Connect Gmail", a docs template might add "Pick a default workspace". See
[Authentication](/docs/authentication) for sign-in setup details.

### Coming back to the checklist

If you hit **Hide setup**, the panel disappears for that browser session.
Required steps that aren't yet complete will surface again on next load. Once
everything required is done, the panel auto-hides for good — there's nothing
left to do.

## For developers

If you're building a template, you register onboarding steps so they appear in
the user's sidebar checklist. The framework handles rendering, completion
tracking, and dismissal — you just declare what the step is and how it's
satisfied.

The system is **auto-mounted**. Templates don't need to wire anything to get
the four built-in steps (LLM, database, auth, email). To add app-specific
steps (Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.), call `registerOnboardingStep()` from a
server plugin.

### Auto-mounted routes

All routes live under `/_agent-native/onboarding/`:

| Route                                               | Purpose                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `GET /_agent-native/onboarding/steps`               | List steps with completion status |
| `POST /_agent-native/onboarding/steps/:id/complete` | Mark step complete (override)     |
| `POST /_agent-native/onboarding/dismiss`            | Dismiss the onboarding banner     |
| `POST /_agent-native/onboarding/reopen`             | Clear dismissal (re-show panel)   |
| `GET /_agent-native/onboarding/dismissed`           | Read dismissal + allComplete flag |

### Adding a step from a template

```ts
// server/plugins/my-onboarding.ts
import { defineNitroPlugin } from "@agent-native/core/server";
import { registerOnboardingStep } from "@agent-native/core/onboarding";

export default defineNitroPlugin(() => {
  registerOnboardingStep({
    id: "gmail",
    order: 100,
    title: "Connect Gmail",
    description: "Grant read/send access so the agent can work with email.",
    methods: [
      {
        id: "oauth",
        kind: "link",
        primary: true,
        label: "Sign in with Google",
        payload: {
          url: "/_agent-native/google/auth-url?scope=mail",
          external: false,
        },
      },
      {
        id: "delegate",
        kind: "agent-task",
        label: "Let the agent set it up",
        badge: "beta",
        payload: {
          prompt: "Walk me through connecting Gmail. Set env vars as needed.",
        },
      },
    ],
    isComplete: () => !!process.env.GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN,
  });
});
```

### Checking Workspace Connections in Onboarding

When building templates that interact with external services (like Slack, Google Workspace, GitHub, or HubSpot), you should check if the workspace has already connected and granted that provider connection to your application. This prevents users from having to duplicate credentials (like API keys or refresh tokens) in their local environment variables when a central, managed connection exists.

You can check connection readiness in your `isComplete` callback using the connection catalog APIs:

```ts
import { listWorkspaceConnectionProviderCatalogForApp } from "@agent-native/core/workspace-connections";

// Inside registerOnboardingStep:
isComplete: async () => {
  // Check if a managed workspace connection exists and is ready
  const catalog = await listWorkspaceConnectionProviderCatalogForApp({
    appId: "mail",
    templateUse: "mail",
    provider: "gmail",
  });
  const connection = catalog.providers[0];

  if (
    connection?.readiness.status === "ready" &&
    connection.workspaceConnection.grantState === "granted"
  ) {
    return true;
  }

  // Fall back to local environment variable check
  return !!process.env.GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN;
};
```

Refer to the [Workspace Connections](/docs/workspace-connections) documentation for the full list of connection provider catalog methods.

### Method kinds

| Kind               | Payload                                               | Use for                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `link`             | `{ url, external? }`                                  | Send user to an OAuth flow or docs page   |
| `form`             | `{ fields, writeScope? }`                             | Collect env vars (keys, secrets, URLs)    |
| `builder-cli-auth` | `{ scope: "llm" \| "browser" \| "image-generation" }` | Connect Builder (unlocks shared infra)    |
| `agent-task`       | `{ prompt }`                                          | Send a prompt to the agent chat to handle |

The `primary: true` flag marks a method as the big CTA for its step.
Use `badge: "soon"` plus `disabled: true` when a setup path should be visible
before it is available.

### Built-in steps

| ID         | Required | Description                                       |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `llm`      | yes      | Builder connection or a provider LLM key          |
| `database` | no       | Default database or any SQL `DATABASE_URL`        |
| `auth`     | no       | Built-in accounts, optional OAuth or access token |
| `email`    | no       | Resend or SendGrid for transactional email        |

Any of these can be overridden by re-registering with the same `id` after the
defaults load.

### Client usage

The panel is already inside `<AgentPanel>`. To build a custom layout:

```tsx
import {
  OnboardingPanel,
  OnboardingBanner,
  useOnboarding,
} from "@agent-native/core/client/onboarding";

function MySidebar() {
  const { allComplete, dismissed, currentStepId } = useOnboarding();
  if (allComplete || dismissed) return <Chat />;
  return (
    <>
      <OnboardingPanel />
      <Chat />
    </>
  );
}
```

see [Security](/docs/security). For end-user messaging touchpoints (invitations,
password resets) that depend on the **Email delivery** step, see
[Messaging](/docs/messaging).
